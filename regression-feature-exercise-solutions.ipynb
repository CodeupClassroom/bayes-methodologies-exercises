    "As a customer analyst, I want to know who has spent the most money with us over their lifetime. I have monthly charges and tenure, so I think I will be able to use those two attributes as features to estimate total_charges. I need to do this within an average of $5.00 per customer.\n",

    "1. Write a function, select_kbest_freg_scaled() that takes X_train, y_train and k as input (X_train and y_train should not be scaled!) and returns a list of the top k features.\n",
    "2. Write a function, select_kbest_freg_unscaled() that takes X_train, y_train (scaled) and k as input and returns a list of the top k features.\n",
    "3. Write a function, ols_backware_elimination() that takes X_train and y_train (scaled) as input and returns selected features based on the ols backwards elimination method.\n",
    "4. Write a function, lasso_cv_coef() that takes X_train and y_train as input and returns the coefficients for each feature, along with a plot of the features and their weights.\n",
    "5. Write 3 functions, the first computes the number of optimum features (n) using rfe, the second takes n as input and returns the top n features, and the third takes the list of the top n features as input and returns a new X_train and X_test dataframe with those top features , recursive_feature_elimination() that computes the optimum number of features (n) and returns the top n features."
