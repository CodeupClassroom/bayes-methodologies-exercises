# Classification Warmup

1. Use `pydataset` to load the `voteincome` dataset.

    ```python
    from pydataset import data

    data('voteincome', show_doc=True)

    data('voteincome')
    ```

1. Drop the `state` and `year` columns.

1. Split the data into train and test datasets. We will be predicting whether or
   not someone votes based on the the remaining features.

1. Fit a k-neighbors classifier on the training data. Use 4 for your number of
   neighbors. How accurate is your model? How does it perform on the test data?

1. Try our these values for k: 1, 2, 3, and 4. Which gives the best accuracy?
   Which gives the best accuracy on the test data set?

1. View the classification report for your best model.

    ```python
    from sklearn.metrics import classifciation_report

    print(classification_report(y, predictions))
    ```

1. Within our problem space, what does accuracy mean? Precision? Recall?
