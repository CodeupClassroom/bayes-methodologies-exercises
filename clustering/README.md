# Clustering

## Modeling Exercises

1. Use the `iris` dataset.

    1. Perform clustering with sepal length, sepal width, and petal length.
    1. Use a k of 4.
    1. Create a 3d visualization that shows your clusters along with the
       features specified above?
    1. Is 4 the optimal number? Try different values of k and visualize your
       results.

1. Use the `mall` dataset.

    1. Perform clustering using annual income and spending score. Try out
       different values for `k`.
    1. Use the resulting clusters to explore your data. What is the center point
       for each cluster in terms of annual income and spending score? What is
       the average age for each cluster?
    1. Create a 3d plot with annual income, spending score, and age. Use color
       to distinguish the clusters you have created.

1. Load the `tips` dataset

    1. Perform k-means clustering with `tip` and `total_bill`. Try a k of 2 and
       a k of 3. Visualize the resulting clusters.
    1. Create a 3d visualization of tip, total bill, and party size. Use color
       to indicate the clusters you have created.
    1. Use the resulting clusters to explore your dataset. What is the average
       party size for each cluster? How many smokers vs non smokers are in each
       cluster? Is this different than in the overall population?
