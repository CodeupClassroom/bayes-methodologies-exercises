# Regression Modeling Warmup

1. Using `pydataset`, load the `faithful` dataset and read it's documentation.

1. What is pearson's r for the two variables?

1. Visualize the relationship between the variables.

1. Build a linear model that predicts `eruptions` based on `waiting`.

1. Create a visualization with your predictions

    1. `waiting` should be on the x axis, and `eruptions` on the y
    1. Use color to differentiate the actual vs predicted values.
    1. Add a descriptive title.
    1. Change the y ticks such that they are all integers (i.e. no decimals)
    1. Add the root mean squared error of your predictions as an annotation
