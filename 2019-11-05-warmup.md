# Clustering Warmup

1. Get the [csv file from here][1].

    This dataset is 50,000 posts from [the relationships subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/). The posts in this subreddit follow a specific format, the poster very often includes their age and their partner's age. Posts without ages for both partners, and posts without a male and female partner are excluded. The female age and male age have been extracted into the first two columns. The third column is the post's unique id, and the fourth is the text of the post.

1. Perform k-means clustering on the combination of male and female age. Add the predicted cluster as another column on the dataframe.

1. Visualize your clustering results. What do you notice? What could you change to fix this?

1. Play with the data! What sort of visualizations can you make, what kind of insights can you come up with?
